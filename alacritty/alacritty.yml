# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator


# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

scrolling:
  # How many lines of scrollback to keep,

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line
  # scrolled when scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number
  # of lines the terminal should scroll when the alternate
  # screen buffer is active. This is used to allow mouse
  # scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # To disable this completely, set `faux_multiplier` to 0.

  # Automatically scroll to the bottom when new text is written
  # to the terminal.

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you
  # probably want this set to false.
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`

  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
